# My-First-Web-Development-Project
This repository contains the code for my "Introduction to HTML" project, developed as part of "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu. The project is a foundational HTML webpage that demonstrates key concepts such as semantic tags, basic text formatting, and hyperlinking.
